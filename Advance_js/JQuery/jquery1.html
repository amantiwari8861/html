        Q.1  what is jQuery 

        i) JQuery is a lightweight write less do more JavaScript library 
        ii) The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JS on your website 
        iii) It takes a lot of common task that requires many lines of JS code to accomplish and 
              wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code 
        iV) jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JS like ajax calls and Dom manipulation 
        v) the jQuery library contains the following features 
            a) hTML / dom manipulation 
            b) cSS manipulation 
            c) hTML event methods 
            d) effects and animation. 
        
        
            Q. 2) there are two versions of jQuery available for downloading which version we should have to choose ? 

            Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed 
            Development version - this is for testing and development(decompressed and readable code) 
            Both versions can be downloaded from jquery.com 
            
            The jQuery library is a single JS file and you reference it with the HTML script tag 
            (notice that the script tag should be inside the head section ) 
            
            Q. 3 what is JQuery syntax ? 
            JQuery Syntax is made for selecting HTML elements and performing some actions on the elements 
            Basic Syntax is: $(selector).action() or jquery(selector).action()
            
            Dollar sign is to define / access jquery 
            a (selector) to "query (or find) html elements " 
            examples . 
            
            1. $(this).hide() - hides the current element 
            2. $("p").hide() - hides all the <p> elements 
            3. $(".test").hide() - hides all the elements with class = "test". 
            4. $("#test").hide() - hides the selected id element = "test"
